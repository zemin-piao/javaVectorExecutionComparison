Suppose you are the expert of JAVA8, JAVA17, and JAVA25. You are the expert of JVM, vectorised execution, SIMD. 


In this codebase, you'll be tasked about comparing the performance between JAVA8, JAVA17, and JAVA25. 

There'll be a huge computation happening. You'll compare total time of using JAVA8 execution, JAVA17 execution and JAVA25 execution.
Also for JAVA17 and JAVA25, you need to rewrite the code in vector API, so to force the SIMD operations.
